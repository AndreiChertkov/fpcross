## Library fpcross

> Solution of the multidimensional Fokker-Planck equation by fast and accurate tensor based methods with cross approximation in the tensor-train (TT) format.

#### Requirements

1. python 3.5;

1. standard python packages like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc. (all of them are included in [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/));

1.  python package [ttpy](https://github.com/oseledets/ttpy);

1. browser based gui for python [jupyter lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) (jupyter notebook).

#### Installation

1. install python 2.7 and standard python packages listed above. The best way is to use Anaconda distribution;

1. install ttpy python package according to instructions from [github repo](https://github.com/oseledets/ttpy);

1. download this repo and open jupyter lab files in browser to run the code in the interactive mode.

> TODO! Add setup file.

#### Tests

#### Examples

  All examples are performed as interactive browser-based jupyter lab notebooks (the corresponding package is included in Anaconda distribution).

  To work with example run in terminal `jupyter lab` (the corresponding page will be opened in the default browser), find in the directory tree the "fpcross/examples" folder, open the corresponding jupyter lab notebook and run all the cells one by one.

  See `./examples/intertrain.ipynb` for interpolation submodule details and `./examples/fpcross.ipynb`  for examples of solver usage.
