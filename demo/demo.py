"""Demo script that shows how to use the Fokker-Planck solver.

Run it from the root of the project as "clear && python demo/demo.py". The
output should look like this (see also the plot "demo/demo_result.png"):
"
Solve: 100step [00:06, 15.09step/s,  | t=2.50 | r=1.0 | e_t=1.50e-02]

The value of PDF at poi=[0, 0, 0] for different time moments:
Time   0.0250 | Value   0.0433
Time   0.0500 | Value   0.0423
Time   0.0750 | Value   0.0413
...
Time   2.4750 | Value   0.0095
Time   2.5000 | Value   0.0094
".

Note:
    To create the new equation, the base (abstract) class "Equation" should be
    inherited (see the class "EquationOwn" below). The detailed description of
    the base class methods and the format of input and output arguments is
    presented in the module "fpcross/equation.py" (online documentation will be
    available soon).

    Numerous parameters of the TT-cross method can be refined when calling the
    "Equation" class method "set_cross_opts". See the documentation for this
    function for more details. At the same time, for all prepared model
    examples (multidimensional simple diffusion problem, multidimensional
    Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and 3-dimensional dumbbell model), a high quality
    solution is obtained with the default values of these parameters.

    For the methods "f", "f1", "r0", "rs", "rt" of the "Equation" class, input
    variable "X" is np.ndarray of the shape [samples, dimensions]. The output
    should be np.ndarray of the shape [samples, dimensions] for "f" and "f1",
    and np.ndarray of the shape [samples] for "r0", "rs" and "rt".
